    "As the data source I have used [United States Patent and Trademark Office(USPTO) website](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets). This source have been recommended by [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2017-10-18-edition) on 10/18/2017.    \n",

    "* __Trademark Case Files Dataset__ : Detailed on millions of trademark applications filed with or registrations issued by the USPTO since 1870  \n",

    "* __Patent Assignment Dataset__: Detailed data patent assignments and other transactions recorded at the USPTO since 1970  \n",

    "* __Trademark Assignment Dataset__: Detailed data on trademark assignments and other transactions recorded at the USPTO since 1955  \n",

    "* __Patent Litigation Docket Reports Data__: Detailed patent litigation data on 74,623 unique district court cases filed during the period 1963-2015  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __PatentsView__: Highly flexible API, search and download query builder, bulk download, and visualization interface for exploring and analyzing 40 years of patent data  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Patent Claims Research Dataset__: Detailed information on claims from U.S. patents granted between 1976 and 2014 and U.S. patent applications published between 2001 and 2014  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Cancer Moonshot Patent Data__: Detailed data on published patent applications and granted patents relevant to cancer research and development  \n",

    "* __Patent Examination Research Dataset (Public PAIR)__: Detailed information on 9.2 million publicly viewable patent applications filed with the USPTO through December 2014  \n",

    "In these categories, there exist huge amount of data. To illustrate, __Patent Assignment Dataset__ includes 1.2GB of zipped csv data just for 2016. Because it is not efficient to investigate whole dataset at once for a limited time, I will explore a sample amount of data in a specific category for this proposal.  \n",

    "For the exploratory analysis, I will use csv format datasets due to size of raw data and time limitation. The csv format datasets represent recent years (after 2014 generally) and  represents a very limited time frame. Therefore, the recent datasets may just provide a cross sectional snapshop.\n",
