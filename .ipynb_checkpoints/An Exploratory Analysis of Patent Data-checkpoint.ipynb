    "The patent data has been investigated  by economic researchers for more than 50 years. The USPTO itself also makes research and analysis on the dataset regularly. However, by the improvements in the technology, globalization, change in the daily life neccessities, and improvement in analytics and data science have changed the context a lot. Currently, using powerful computers we are able to __clean__ huge amount of data in a very short time. In addition, using advance __Machine Learning__ techniques, we are able to analyze huge amount of data in a few hours. Furthermore, we can use a significant amount of data to train our models and make much more accurate inferences. In the past, not only it was difficult to reach the data but also it was difficult to apply several ML techniques as we do using gridsearch and pipelines. We  had to sample a very small portion of the data and make inferences due to manual work.  \n",
